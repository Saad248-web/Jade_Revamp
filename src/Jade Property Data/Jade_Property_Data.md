# Jade Hospitainment — Property Data (canonical)

> Source: `Jade_Hospitainment_Property_Portfolio_v33.docx`. This file is the **single data source** for the villas seed and the public listings. It carries operational data only (identity, pricing, capacity, specs, location, amenities, add-ons). Full marketing prose (Visual Walkthrough, Sales Pitch) stays in the docx and can be folded in per property if this `.md` is also to drive public page copy.
>
> **Rules:** All money below is in **rupees** for human reading — the seed must convert to **paise** via `rupeesToPaise()`. All prices are **+ 18% GST** unless a GST-inclusive figure is given. Fields marked `[TBD]` or `[CONFLICT]` MUST be confirmed by the property team before seeding — the seed must **fail loudly** on a missing required field, never default to a placeholder.

# Data conflicts & gaps to confirm before seeding

These block a correct seed because capacity drives extra-pax and event pricing. The property team must resolve them — do not invent values.

- **Magnolia:** bedroom count (4 BR vs 3 BR + family room); parking (25 vs 200–300); extra-bed capacity typo (40–30 → 30–40); base 12 vs sales-pitch "25–30"; bathrooms unconfirmed.
- **Emerald:** subtitle (Glass Villa vs Rustic Farmhouse vs traditional Indian).
- **Tranquil Woods:** extended stay capacity blank; kids' pool dims blank; lawn area (1.3 acre vs 50,000 sq ft garden).
- **Blue Dome:** living-room seated/floating capacity blank; cluster parking (20–25 narrative vs 20–30 specs table).
- **Yellow Dome:** parking blank; confirm 3 BR / 2 bath.
- **Retreat:** villa built-up (1,840 vs 5,000 sq ft); lawn seated typo (15–10 → 10–15).
- **Lemon Tree:** plot (2 vs 3 acres); confirm three-storey vs floor descriptions.
- **Haven:** every driving distance except Byg Brewski / Meco Kartopia is blank.
- **Diamond Pavilion:** site area (50,000 sq ft vs 2 acres); building floors (3 vs 4); **dorm capacity (20 vs 50 vs 20–30) and total (70)** — three different figures across intro/walkthrough/capacity table, confirm; it drives the event price band.
- **Jade 735:** pool size blank; depth field holds the dimensions (mislabeled); BHK title bracketed.
- **Global:** strip authoring brackets `[ … ]` from all capacity figures before publishing — many are unconfirmed estimates.
- **Out of scope (by design):** itemized meal-plan inclusions (e.g. what's in a Standard Lunch/BBQ package) and full marketing-prose amenity detail (e.g. Jade 735's mist-walkway, mirror feature, bar counter) live only in the docx; this `.md` carries add-on pricing and condensed amenity summaries only. Pull from the docx directly if a menu PDF or full-prose listing page needs to be built.
